# Fractals

This project is a fractal generator that interacts with an Ethereum smart contract on the Kakarot testnet. It generates fractal images (Mandelbrot and Julia sets) and allows users to interact with the smart contract by sending small amounts of Ether.

## Features

- Generate Mandelbrot and Julia fractal images
- Interact with an Ethereum smart contract on the Kakarot testnet
- Visualize fractals using `react-konva` and `konva`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/welttowelt/fractals.git
