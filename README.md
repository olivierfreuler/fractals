# Fractals Project

This project demonstrates how to interact with an Ethereum smart contract on the Kakarot test network using Rust. It includes a function to calculate fractal values (Mandelbrot set) and sends these values to a smart contract.

## Steps Taken

1. Set up a new Rust project and added necessary dependencies.
2. Created and deployed a smart contract on the Kakarot test network.
3. Implemented a Rust program to calculate fractal values and interact with the deployed smart contract.
4. Sent a transaction to the smart contract and verified its execution.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/welttowelt/fractals.git
